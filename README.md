/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

- Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwind’s layers to your ./src/index.css file.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
